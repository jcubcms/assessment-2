## Branches

## Main Branches
The project has two main branches 
Master Branch: The branch used by production site
Staging Branch: THe branch used by staging site(used by local environment)

## Feature Branches
While developing new feature for theme, the theme does not work directly.So we often used staging sites as a testing ground in order to prevent errors occurring on 'live' websites, thus avoiding the issues and/or downtime that might otherwise result. 
 
 For example:
 1. Start with the master branch
 2. Create a new-branch
 3. Update, add, commit, and push changes
 4. Push feature branch to remote

## Developemt Environment Setup
Follow these instruction for the setting up development environment

## Working on site content
To make the site as easy as possible and to divide the workflow.
We used collabration tools like slack and trello to make our tasks  and to easily divide work and github for version contro and sharing code with teammates.
Dividing task and keeping track of task was to be made easy with trello but unfortunately our team wasn't to proactive creating cards for trello.

## Deployment Instructions
A starter theme from underscores starter theme builder was created. 
We uploaded that folder to the repository of our theme in github. 
A Wordpress website was created in local host and put this folder in the themes of the local host which helped us as we edit any code it use to reflect in the local environment. 
Also, we were connected on the github when ever anyone make any changes in the code or the folders they push it in the github it keeps a track of the work and if anything goes wrong we can revert the comment and get back the code before errors.
